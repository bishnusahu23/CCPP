# Combined Cycle Power Plant- Energy Production Model
The energy production prediction model was developed to forecast energy output based on various environmental factors. The key features utilized in the model included:

- Temperature: The ambient temperature, which can affect energy production efficiency.
- Ambient Pressure: The atmospheric pressure, which may influence the operational conditions of energy production systems.
- Exhaust Vacuum: The vacuum level in exhaust systems, crucial for maintaining optimal operational performance.
- Relative Humidity: The moisture content in the air, which can impact energy production.

## Data Analysis
The dataset was thoroughly analyzed to understand the relationships between the input features and the target variable (energy production).
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques were employed to visualize and assess patterns, correlations, and potential outliers within the data.

### Regression Techniques Applied
Multiple regression techniques were applied to determine the best model for predicting energy production. 

## The techniques included:
- Linear Regression: A basic approach to establish a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
- Regularization Techniques: Such as Elastic Net to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
- Ensemble Methods: Implemented techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost to leverage the strengths of multiple models for better accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics:
The model's accuracy was assessed using:  

R-squared: To measure the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.   
Mean Squared Error (MSE): To quantify the average squared difference between predicted and actual values

## Model Performance
The final model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96%, indicating a strong ability to predict energy production based on the input features. This high accuracy suggests that the model can effectively inform decision-making processes related to energy management and optimization.

## Conclusion
The model demonstrates the significant impact of environmental factors on energy production, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the energy sector. Further improvements and adjustments can enhance its predictive capabilities, making it a robust tool for future applications.
